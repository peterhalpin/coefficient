This is an example of a minimal web application that uses TogetherJS. 

To add TogetherJS functionality to your application, you must add 4 lines of HTML:

1. <script src="https://togetherjs.com/togetherjs-min.js"></script>
This provides the interface for TogetherJS. It is hosted on Mozilla's site.

2. <script>TogetherJSConfig_hubBase = "https://sustaining-classic-beam.glitch.me/"; </script>
This specifies the server hub that processes everybody's TogetherJS activity. 
The Mozilla-hosted one is down, so this is a copy of their server code that I am hosting on a free site.
The server code is available in the server.js file in this directory.

3. <script> TogetherJSConfig_suppressJoinConfirmation = true </script>  
This makes it so that there is no pop-up to explain TogetherJS when the page opens up.

4. <script> TogetherJSConfig_autoStart = true </script>  
This makes it so that TogetherJS is loaded at the time when the page itself loads.
