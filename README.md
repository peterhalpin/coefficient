The idea behind Coefficient is simple. Instructors will prepare a static web project that they intend to use for group work. The basic elements of such a project include: 

* HTML file named “index.html” (REQUIRED)
* CSS file for styling (optional)
* JavaScript file to facilitate interaction (optional)
* CSV or JSON file to include external data (optional)

Once logged into Coefficient, instructors are able to upload their project files and assign a name for their game’s activity. The HTML file will be modified to embed the functionality of TogetherJS - a library that allows users to jointly interact with the same instance of a web page, view each other’s cursors, and chat with one another. Think of the collaborative aspect of Google Docs, and imagine how it might work on a web page. That’s what TogetherJS does. After TogetherJS is added, the TogetherJS-enabled project will be hosted and a URL will be provided to access the activity.

Instructors are able to view a list of every project they have published, and add or delete projects as necessary. When it is time for them to use an activity in the classroom, they can specify the number of groups that they want to create and the application will generate that number of unique URLs, each of which corresponds to a unique session of that activity. Students can then be assigned a URL, and when they visit the URL they will be able to chat and interact with their group members, who were assigned the same URL. All information about student interactions and chat messages can be optionally logged, providing opportunities to research how students interact with each other in the virtual classroom.

So, to summarize, Coefficient provides the following value to instructors:

* Ability to host static web applications with minimal knowledge about servers and hosting.
* Easily manage and access all class activities.
* Allow students to collaborate in groups on a web activity without the need for an external communication device.
* Generate unique URLs for an activity which correspond to different groups of students.
* View interactions between students on published web activities.
