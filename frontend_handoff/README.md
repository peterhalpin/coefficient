Student interactivity is one of the driving factors of learning, so in this project our goal was to emphasize the ability for real-time updates between computer screens while doing group activities online. 

This teacher-serving platform allows for teachers to upload HTML, CSS, JS, and game data files to the session manager which applies TogetherJS functionality for hosting multiplayer games. From your list of saved games you can enter in the number of groups you want to generate URLs for. This will generate that number of links that take you to hosted versions of the web app and each specific link offers multiplayer functionality when each student nagivates to it.
